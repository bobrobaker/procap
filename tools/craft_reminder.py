"""PreToolUse hook: one-line reminder before edits to governed material.

Tier 2 of the enforcement split: the harness guarantees firing, the agent supplies
the judgment. Three properties are load-bearing — fires once per session (a reminder
that repeats becomes noise), never blocks, and fails open (malformed input exits
silently; a reminder has no business stopping work).

Wire in .claude/settings.json:

    {"hooks": {"PreToolUse": [{"matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "python3 tools/craft_reminder.py"}]}]}}
